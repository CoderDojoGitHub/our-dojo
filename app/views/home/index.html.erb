      CoderDojo is a free coding class, held every other Saturday at the GitHub San Francisco office, for kids ages 6â€“18 years old. We teach all kinds of topics like building websites, video games, chat apps, drawing apps, and many others. Sessions last about two hours and have a short lunch break in the middle. If you would like more information about the CoderDojo organization, or to find one in your area, head over to <a href="http://www.coderdojo.com">http://www.coderdojo.com</a>.
