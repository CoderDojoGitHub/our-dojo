    <p>
      CoderDojo SF is coming back, run by a new group mentors. Emmie Chang and Karen Sijbrandij will be taking over as lead organizers and looking for more mentors/volunteers to help out! Here’s how they describe themselves:

      Your information is important to us. We’re giving them the name “CoderDojoSF” so that they can use with their own accounts, but we will not be giving them your contact information or any data that you have provided to us. If you are interested in receiving information about their future sessions, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/bFQzWP">join their mailing list</a>. They will be sending details about the future of CoderDojo SF soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because CoderDojoSF will no longer be associated with GitHub, and to make room for Camperoo’s dojo, we will be closing down all of our sites/accounts, with the exception of our GitHub account, which will now be found at https://github.com/CoderDojoGitHub. All of our lessons will remain there should you ever wish to revist them.
    </p>

    <p>
      We would like to personally thank you for your past participation in CoderDojo GitHub and hope that you enjoy the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      &lt;3 and octocats,<br>
      Cameron and all the mentors
